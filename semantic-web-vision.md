# Second Generation Semantic Web Vision: Relationship at the core of it
At the heart of second generation Semantic Web is Semantic Associations a.k.a Relationships. Relationships lend meaning to information, makes them understandable and actionable, and provides new and possibly unexpected insights. Therefore, there’s a fundamental shift in focus from ‘documents’ and ‘entities within documents’ to discovering and reasoning about relationships. 


The perspective of data as KNOWLEDGE was a critical movement in the world of BigData. Let's go into a lil back and peek into the history:

## 1. History
### The emergence of a “Web of Data”:
The `Web of Data` has undergone rampant growth with the publication of large datasets – often as Linked Data - by public institutions around the world.  Varied range of players such as crowd sourcing projects like dbpedia, web companies like WWW, schema.org, open-data publishers like data.gov, data.worldbank.org have contributed in publishing open data. This development paved way for mainly two things: 
- Semantic Web technologies and 
- Ontology: Standard vocabularies to describe semantics of the data that helped in exposing, sharing and connecting data.

### 1.1 Semantic Web Technologies:
Accessing and consuming data on the Web should not require end users to be aware of where to find the data (which datasets) and how it is represented. This has thrust Semantic technologies into limelight.

**Semantic web vision:** Capture semantic association between entities (or resources) and allow user to formulate NLQ (Natural Language Queries) to find semantic association(s).

**Capturing Semantic associations between entities using RDF:**
To support NLQ, one should capture semantic associations between entities. Semantic associations essentially indicates how one entity (or resource) is related to other entity. Resource Description Framework (RDF) data model provides a framework for describing relationships among resources in terms of uniquely identified properties (attributes) and values.

### 1.2 Ontology - Standard Vocabulary to describe semantics of the data
**Problem:** One of the current challenges for accessing and consuming data on the Web is dealing with heterogeneity, i.e. data can be distributed and duplicated in different data stores, and described by different custom schema’s (or vocbulary). 
**Solution:** Standardise these custom schema’s.
**Ontology - Provides standard vocabulary per domain:** A formal naming and definition was given for the types, properties, and interrelationships of the entities for a specific domain. Web companies like www, schema.org and linked open vocabulary took initiatives and published standard reusable linked vocabulary ecosystem. The initiative was not only to collect vocabulary metadata but also to promote good practice and improve overall ecosystem quality. Below picture illustrates example ontology of Organisation domain:

## 2. Second Generation Semantic Web
A second generation `Semantic Web` is being realised as a scalable ontology-driven information system where the heterogenous data content is linked meaning with semantic metadata. It is not uncommon that the hunt for entity associations surfaces too many relationships between them thereby, making it equally important to rank them in order to find interesting and meaningful relationships before presenting them to end user.
